# trebekbot

An activity bot for Slack. It measures activity and talks whenever there is activity in a specific channel.

## Requirements

You'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com) account, obviously, and a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account to host the bot. You'll also need to be able to set up new integrations in Slack; if you're not able to do this, contact someone with admin access in your organization.

## Installation

1. Set up a Slack outgoing webhook at https://slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook. Keep the trigger word blank, as you want the bot to note all conversation.

2. Grab the token for the outgoing webhook you just created, and a Slack API token, which you can get from https://api.slack.com/web.

3. Click this button to set up your Heroku app: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)   
If you'd rather do it manually, then just clone this repo, set up a Heroku app with Redis Cloud (the free level is more than enough for this), and deploy trebekbot there. Make sure to set up the config variables in
[.env.example](https://github.com/muziejus/activitybot/blob/master/.env.example) in your Heroku app's settings screen.

4. Point the outgoing webhook to https://[YOUR-HEROKU-APP].herokuapp.com

## Usage

The bot listens on all channels and makes a redis entry every time someone
speaks. Two variables determine when the bot will announce that a channel is
alive, with `ENV[NUMBER_OF_CHATTERS]` team members speaking over the course of
`ENV[MINUTES]` minutes in the same channel. The default is set to three members
speaking in the same channel over the course of two minutes. This is obviously
designed for small teams that don't have a lot of chatter, but where FOMO is
high.

If both conditions are met, the bot announces in `ENV[CHANNEL]` that there is
activity in a channel. The idea is that people who have FOMO have notifications
set on on the announcement channel, so they are alerted. The default is
"#zbullpen," but you can use something more clever if you like.

Once the alert goes out, the bot waits `ENV[WAIT_TIME]` minutes before polling
it again, so it's not constantly announcing activity. The default is a half
hour.
